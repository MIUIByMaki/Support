## Support & Log

Please report any bugs or issues directly in the official group. It's challenging for me to understand what's going on when you report things that seem to be happening on Mars. I'm not on Mars, I'm on [Talk Group](https://github.com/MIUIByMaki/Support/blob/main/Readme.md#official-support-group-on-telegram). Please take the time to read the notes before reporting any issues, and kindly provide logs, as this is essential for us to provide assistance.

It's important to note that some individuals may not be entirely honest when claiming they've read the notes and guides. I urge you not to follow that example and collaborate with me so that I can assist you to the best of my abilities.
